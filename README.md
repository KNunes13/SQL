# SQL Kayla Nunes' SQL Portfolio  

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains examples of SQL I have written. Please feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions: kaynunes13@gmail.com




Movies_Shows is a personal project I took on as I taught myself SQL, and it has evolved quite a bit from the original idea. The database features information of different media I have watched, the names of those who were both on screen talent and behind the camera, and the genres that are particular to each.
