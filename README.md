# SQL Kayla Nunes' SQL Portfolio  

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains examples of SQL I have written. Please feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions: kaynunes13@gmail.com

Movies_Shows is a personal project I took on as I taught myself how to work with MySQL, and it has evolved quite a bit from the original idea. The database features information of different media I have watched, the names of those who were both on screen talent and behind the camera, and the genres that are particular to each.
Each value was inputted by hand, with relevant information being taken from online sources like IMDB. The biggest benefit to having created this project from scratch is that I had to come to grasp with advanced SQL formatting early on in my practice to achieve the result I had envisioned, namely the multitude of relationship tables as well the many join and union queries required to clarify the data.
